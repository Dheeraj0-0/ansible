🤖 Ansible Playbook Practice 🛠️

This space is dedicated to my work and practice with Ansible playbooks. Here, you'll find various automation scripts I'm using to learn and experiment with Ansible.

My goal is to automate different tasks and configuration management. Feel free to explore the playbooks and see how Ansible can be used for system automation.
